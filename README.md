# Project 4: Stock Analysis for Top Five High-Tech Companies

# Objectives & Approach

## Project Objective
Create a neural network model that will predict stock prices of 5 top tech companies

## Dataset
Used a kaggle dataset with stock prices for:

- Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD)
- Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL)
- Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (NYSE: HP)
- Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
- Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA)


## Discussion Overview:
Created a neural network regression model that attempts to predict the stock prices of 5 top tier tech companies 
Requires further optimization to determine the best settings (# nodes, # layers, activation, etc)

## Challenges
- Model recognizes the overall trends but overshoots its predictions
- Model struggles with high priced stock more than low priced stock (more variability)
- Time


## Source
- High-tech stock prices
- Stock Closing Price Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques

## Team members:
